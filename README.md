Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to extract meaningful insights that can aid in decision-making processes. Utilizing data visualization tools, the project aims to identify patterns and trends within the loan dataset, providing a comprehensive understanding of the bank's lending activities.

Problem Statement
Banks often deal with vast amounts of loan data, making it challenging to monitor and assess lending activities effectively. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to identify trends, assess risk, and make informed decisions regarding loan approvals and policies. There is a need for a systematic approach to analyze loan data, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into key performance indicators and improve the overall lending process.

Methodology
The project was executed through the following steps:

Data Collection: Gathered relevant loan data from the bank's database, ensuring it included necessary attributes such as loan amount, interest rates, borrower information, and repayment status.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processed the raw data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format it appropriately for analysis.

Data Analysis: Utilized analytical tools to explore the dataset, identifying key metrics and trends related to loan approvals, defaults, and repayments.

Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards to represent the analyzed data visually, making it easier to interpret and derive insights.
